**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**


    The Gaming Room was a game company that requested I make a game titled "Draw It or Lose It". They needed this game to work on multiple platforms and they wanted it based on their already existing game on Android. 

Design Constraints

    1. Each team has multiple members assigned to them
    2. The game needs to allow multiple teams to be involved
    3. Game and Team names must be unique and allow users to check if the name is already taken or available
    4. Only one instance of the game can exist at a time
    5. Needs to run on multiple platforms

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
    
    I believe I did job explaining the Domain Model in detail, this helped me understand how the program needed to flow. In addition, it helped me visualize what methods needed to be implemented and those which should be inherited. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

    As stated above the Domain Model was extremely helpful in realizing what variables and methods needed to be created or inherited for the program to work together cohesively and implement OOP.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

    I would revise the Evaluation portion of my document. I would add further detail in the Client Side and Development Tools portion to flesh out the benefits more effectively for each platform.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

    I read through what The Gaming Room was looking for in their game and wrote down the key points to ensure the final product reflected exactly what their company was looking for in their user experience and nothing extra. It is important to consider the user's needs because if a user has a memorable experience with the game, they will keep coming back and even spread the word about the product that was developed. This increases revenue and reputation of both companies, this is a win-win for both companies and even the user.


**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
    
    I thought about which platforms we would be launching, as well as the existing code from Android, to decide what language would suit the program the best and be most efficient with our time. I would use the Domain Model to layout how the program needs to flow as well as the Executive Summary and Recommendations sections to convey what needs to be created and what my recommendations would be for technology and platforms.
